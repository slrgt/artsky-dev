# artsky-dev

This repo holds the **dev deployment** of [ArtSky](https://github.com/slrgt/artsky).

- **What it is:** The built output of the ArtSky app when code is pushed to the **`dev`** branch of the main [artsky](https://github.com/slrgt/artsky) repo. GitHub Actions builds that branch and pushes the result here so you can test the dev version online before merging to `main`.
- **Dev site:** **https://slrgt.github.io/artsky-dev/** (replace `slrgt` with your GitHub username if you forked).
- **Do not edit this repo by hand.** The next push to `dev` will overwrite it. To change the dev site, push to the `dev` branch of the [artsky](https://github.com/slrgt/artsky) repo.

The live (production) site is at **https://slrgt.github.io/artsky/** and is updated when you push or merge to the **`main`** branch of artsky.
